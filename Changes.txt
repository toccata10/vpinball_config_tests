This tries to address the flaws of the current configgen:
* the VPinballX.ini is copied to VPinballX-configgen.ini. The VPinballX.ini is never touched. The configgen recreates and edits the VPinballX-configgen.ini at each launch of a table
* if the VPinballX.ini contains duplicates, it doesn't crash anymore: the default  VPinballX.ini is copied to VPinballX-configgen.ini. That's a bad idea imo: a crash seems better to me to force legacy users to start with a clean VPinballX.ini, but I was asked to deal with that. Problem is also that it will completely ignore values in the user VPinballX.ini with duplicates. Unsolvable problem as I don't want to touch VPinballX.ini anymore.
* Behaviour for pinmamedmd, flexdmd, b2s and b2sdmd come from values in the VPinballX.ini which leads to poor positions and sizes imo.
The user can choose from a simplified preset for pinmamedmd, flexdmd, b2s to display left or right and small, medium or large.
There's an automatic conversion to preserve the aspect when switching from 1080p to 4k (or anything else) by calculation based on percentage rather than absolute pixel coordinates. It's trasnparent to the user.
* By default: there ./ in VPinballX.ini, which leads to a per table folder organisation. Switchable with a toogle.
* By default: the configgen is not active. Switchable with a toogle to activate the configgen
* table.ini file always overrides the settings from the configgen
